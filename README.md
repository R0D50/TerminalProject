# TerminalProject
Members: Roderick Jacobs, Daniel Austin, Whitney Jones
Responsibilities: We all wrote our own individual code for this project. We then compaired our shell programs to see which one was the most stream lined and effecient.
Description: This project is a simple shell program written in C called techshell. The goal of this assignment was to better understand how a basic shell works by allowing users to type commands, have them parsed, and then executed by the program.
Instructions: First clone the repo with the command git clone (https://github.com/R0D50/TerminalProject.git) cd techshell, Then compile it using this command gcc techshel.c -o techshell, And now run the file with ./techshell.c
All parts are fully implemented
