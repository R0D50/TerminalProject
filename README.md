# TerminalProject
Members: Roderick Jacobs, Daniel Austin, 
Responsibilities: We all wrote our own individual code for this project. 
Description: This project implements a simplified Unix-style shell called techshell using the C programming language. The shell continuously displays a prompt showing the current working directory, waits for user input, parses the command, and executes it in a child process using system calls such as.
Instructions: git clone <your-github-repo-url> cd techshell, gcc -Wall -Wextra -o techshell techshell.c
All parts are fully implemented
